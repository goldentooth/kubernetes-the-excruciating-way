# Killing the Incubator

At this point, given the ease of spinning up new applications with the `gitops-repo` `ApplicationSet`, there's really not much benefit to the `Incubator` app-of-apps repo.

I'd also added a way of easily spinning up generic projects, but I don't think that's necessary either. The `ApplicationSet` approach is really pretty powerful ðŸ™‚
