# Kubernetes, the _Excruciating_ Way

Basically just a journal of me working through creating and configuring and doing a bunch of stuff with a Kubernetes cluster.

Obviously, this owes a lot to Kelsey Hightower's [_Kubernetes the Hard Way_](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way) and its various derivatives, many of which I may have pillaged in desperation while banging my head against various walls.

Despite the name, this shouldn't be interpreted as an "even lower-level _Kubernetes the Hard Way_." That's just a joke. It's only excruciating because I'm writing it 🙂

I'm working on some Kubernetes certifications (CKA, CKAD, CKS), and in typical [Nug Doug](https://github.com/ndouglas/) fashion I'm diving in headfirst and probably going to burn myself out instead of taking a more measured, rational, sustainable pace.

The end result of this should be a working, high-availability Kubernetes cluster that I know inside and out. Because I'm rapidly aging and have an _okay_ memory (and also a love of memes), I'm going to document the crap out of the entire process.
