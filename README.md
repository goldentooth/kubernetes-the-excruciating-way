# Kubernetes, the _Excruciating_ Way

Obviously, this owes a lot to Kelsey Hightower's [_Kubernetes the Hard Way_](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way) and its various derivatives, many of which I may have pillaged in desperation while banging my head against various walls.

I'm working on some Kubernetes certifications, and in typical Nate fashion I'm diving in headfirst and probably going to burn myself out instead of taking a more measured, rational, sustainable pace.

The end result of this should be a working, high-availability Kubernetes cluster that I know inside and out. Because I'm rapidly aging and have an _okay_ memory (and also a love of memes), I'm going to document the crap out of the entire process.
